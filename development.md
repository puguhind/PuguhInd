> **Please note:** Unfortunately we didn't have the time to finish the developer docs. We'll finish this page as soon as possible, so please stay in touch.

If you're searching for information about how to upgrade your plugin to Pico 1.0 (we appreciate that!), you can find basic information in the Pull Request message of [#252][PullRequest252] and its comments (especially [this comment][PullRequest252UpgradeNotes]). The changes were wide-ranging, so until we finish the docs (help is appreciated!), we advise you to really read the Pull Request message and, at least, skim through all comments.

If you have a question about one of the new features of Pico 1.0, please comment on [#252][PullRequest252] (although the Pull Request is closed!). If you have a problem with upgrading your plugin, please do the same. If you experience a problem with Pico in general, please refer to the [upgrade page][Upgrade]. If this doesn't answer your question, please notice the ["Getting help" section][GettingHelp] of the docs and open a new [Issue][Issues] on GitHub.
