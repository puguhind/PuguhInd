This is Pico's official robots plugin.

`PicoRobots` is a simple plugin that add a `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` to your website. Both the [robots exclusion protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard) (`robots.txt`) and the [Sitemaps protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps) (`sitemap.xml`) are used to communicate with web crawlers and other web robots. `robots.txt` informs the web robot about which areas of your website should not be processed or scanned. `sitemap.xml` allows web robots to crawl your website more intelligently. `sitemap.xml` is a URL inclusion protocol and complements `robots.txt`, a URL exclusion protocol.
