`PicoFilePrefixes` removes file prefixes (e.g. date identifiers) from page URLs.

For example, the blog article `content/blog/20160707.visit-us-on-github.md` normally corresponds to the page URL <https://example.com/pico/blog/20160707.visit-us-on-github>, however, by installing this plugin, the article will be accessible through the much more user-friendly URL <https://example.com/pico/blog/visit-us-on-github>. This makes organizing your website's pages on the filesystem easier than ever before.
