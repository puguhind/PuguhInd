## Pico Core

It's generally not a good idea to make modifications to the core of Pico. If you
are looking to add or change functionality, can it be accomplished with a plugin?

If not, and you want to contribute to Pico's core please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md]({{ site.gh_project_url }}/blob/{{ site.gh_project_branch }}/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub.
