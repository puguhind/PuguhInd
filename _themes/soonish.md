soonish theme is a free and open source portfolio theme, featuring a responsive design and automatically generating directory listings for subfolders.

soonish was forked from another two-column theme, [simpleTwo](https://github.com/sonst-was/simpleTwo), with additional features added, and a directory listing feature adapted from [pico-femto](https://github.com/randomchars42/pico-femto).
