Pico's default theme is included with your Pico install.

This barebones template can act as a great starting point for making your own theme.

Getting started with development is easy.  Simply make a copy of the default theme folder (located at `themes/default/`) and change your `config/config.yml` to reflect the folder name of your copy.

Looking at the default theme is also a great point of reference for writing or customizing any theme!
